    "A loop is something occurs again and again, until a specified stop condition is met. There are two types of loops: ones that have a fixed number of iterations (for loops), and ones that iterate until a condition is satisfied (while loops). For loops are extremely common in science; for example, if you have a bunch of data files and you want to process each one the same way. While loops can be useful in numerical solvers for nonlinear equations.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. In the cell below, create a function called `evaluate_parabola_numpy` that uses numpy arrays to evaluate the parabola. It will probably look very similar to `evaluate_line_numpy`. Remember to add a docstring!  \n",
    "2. Plot lines generated using `evaluate_parabola_list` and `evaluate_parabola_numpy` on top of one another. Do they match?  \n",
    "    * **ANSWER**: *(Insert your text here: -->*✔ Both functions produce the same plot** → `evaluate_parabola_numpy` works correctly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚡ Performance Comparison:\n",
    "- **NumPy (`evaluate_parabola_numpy`)** → ✅ **Faster**, processes entire arrays efficiently.  \n",
    "- **List-based (`evaluate_parabola_list`)** → ❌ **Slower**, loops through each value one by one.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**📌 Conclusion:** **NumPy is the better choice for large datasets!** 🚀\n",
    "    - Both functions produce identical plots, confirming that evaluate_parabola_numpy correctly implements the quadratic formula.\n",
    "    - The NumPy implementation is much faster because it processes arrays efficiently.\n",
    "    - The list-based function (evaluate_parabola_list) loops through each element, making it slower for large datasets.!)*"
